# HiveCom

**This projects aim**: Automatically monitor a beehive to assist a beekeeper in interpreting the bees health and current state in short and long terms. 


**Starting situation**: As I got a lot into electronics and making in the high school, my teacher provided me with the possiblity to do an extra learning project to contribute to my high school diploma 2021. And we do beekeeping as an extracurricular at our high school!

**Why am I doing this**: I really like electronics, understanding systems and using / creating them. While playing around with Raspberry Pis / Arduinos and sensor kits, my head filled with ideas. My grandma was a beekeeper so I always had a good connection to bees. My teacher actually had the idea of monitoring the bees at the school.

**My ambition**: Besides getting into the material myself and trying out different protocols, techniques and parts, I want to have a nice, elegant solution in the end.

**Roadmap**: The project is divided into two parts as I built two mostly completely different systems for monitoring.

**This repository**: Summary / loose documentation of the project to store experiences into.

**Credits**: Many thanks to my kind teacher for supporting me, not only for making this project even possible, but also for the anwering of all kinds of questions regarding beekeeping and funding this project.

Also thanks to the Sch√ºlerforschungszentrum Hamburg for supporting / aiding me building and testing the weight scale and the power supply.

# First solution (called Honey Pi)

The first solution, I built with the help of the [honey-pi.de](honey-pi.de)-tutorial. It is a very nice website from kind people sharing their experiences monitoring their bees with a Raspberry Pi system. Next to the Pi, the main components are a solar panel, car battery, cellular surf-stick for data upload and the weight scale as well as inside and outside temperature and humidity. The solar panel charges the car battery, the car battery poweres the Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi collects the sensor data and uploads it to the Thingspeak IoT webservice.

## What are the systems components

1. Small car battery, solar panel, charging module
2. Raspberry Pi Zero (not Zero W) mini linux computer, containing prebuilt Python agents for data upload
3. Sensors:
    - 1x DHT22 sensor for temperature & humidity inside the beehive (custom case for bee protection)
    - 1x DHT22 sensor for temperature & humideity outside
    - 1x Bosche H30a weight cell + HX711 weightcell amplifier for continuously weighting the whole beehive
    - 1x voltage divider for checking battery voltage (of around 12V)
4. Uploading via USB-Surfstick with sim card over mobile radio
5. Using the Thingspeak webservice from Mathworks
    1. Stores data for one year for free
    2. Provides nice Rest API for communication between Raspberry Pi & Thingspeak
    3. Modular dashboard vizualization of the data on graphs & widgets
6. Own website that gatheres the data from Thingspeak and displays it in a prettier way

## Experiences

This first solution took around one year to build. I submitted this to my high school exam and got 15/15 points. Yeah!

**Advantages of the system**:
- completely autonomous, if you ignore mobile radio connection strength and if you choose a free mobile phone contract
- beefy power supply & a lot of processing power
- Convenient webservice for configuration

**Disadvantages of the system**:
- Linux & so much processing power on an IoT device is overkill (I do not need a lot of data analysis onboard). The IoT device could run on a lot less energy.
- I did not really understand, what those Python scripts really do and I did not trust them
- Shaky beehive position, as it was placed on one small weight cell
- Raspberry Pi always fully on (ca. 150mA at 5V (0.75W)), no sleep function
- Dependancy on ThingSpeak online service with its one year data storage
- It's not really my solution xD

Especially in my implementation:
- Bad connection to sensors because of using breadboards as permanent circuit
- Somehow the system didn't worked really long and I was annoyed and didn't know what to do
- DHT22 sensor inside the beehive was broken as formic acid for bee treatment destroyed it. Also, in beforehand it was always wet because of condensation water in the top of the hive.

**Other experiences building the project**
- Difficulties with high temperature dependancy in weight
- the beefy car battery still ran out


# Second solution (called HiveCom)

After my high school exam, the Honey-Pi solution didn't work properly after a short period of time, and I decided to start a completely new project. I didn't really knew why exactly I spent so much time/energy on it, but somehow I wanted to end this project recently and get it finally working, so now its 2024. I spent a lot of my free time between the study semesters (5th / 6th) of computer science & engineering on this and I am proud that it finally is done! It installed at the hive on April 11th, 2024!

**The live data is publicly available here**:
[hivecom.neozeo.de](hivecom.neozeo.de)


In this solution, I did everything by myself:
1. IoT device at the beehive
2. Lora/Wifi Gateway device
3. Self-designed LoRa "protocol"
4. Self-setup docker environment on virtual server with:
    1. Influx data base
    2. Grafana dashboard vizualization


**The system consists of four big parts**:

## 1. IoT node at the beehive

<img src="./img/IoT-Node.jpg" width="45%">
<img src="./img/IoT-Node2.png" width="30%">

1. Powered by manually rechargable LiPo batteries (2x 2500mAh at 3.7V in parallel)
2. ESP32 as microcontroller for sensor data handling & upload
3. Sensors
    - DHT22 for outside temperature & humidity measurement
    - DS18B20 (watertight) for inside temperature measurement
    - 4x smaler Bosche H10a weight cells plus 4x HX711 weight cell amplifier chips
4. ATtiny84 as second microcontroller for HX711 management
    (The ESP32 has not enough pins to connect all HX711-chips, so I used an Attiny as an IO-middle-man that connects the HX711 chips to the ESP32 as an I2C slave)
5. Periodic data upload over LoRa

For the **schematic**, see "IoT Node Schematic.pdf" file in this repository

Features:
- Maybe half year of battery power supply by using deep sleep mode (I will see)
- Debug mode for checking sensor values at the hive
- Changing upload interval via debug mode button (1min, 5min, 20min, 60min, 120min, 360min)
- Easy access to components & see-through case for extra fancyness


## 2. LoRa/WiFi gateway

<img src="./img/Gateway.jpg" width="40%">

Small device in the school that receives the LoRa Message broadcasted from the IoT node. It is connected to the school WiFi and uploads beehive & maintenance data to my Influx database.

Features:
- Left-button function: See most recent uploaded sensor values
- Middle-button function: View upload log or maybe errors
- Right-button function: RICK ROLL video! (I didn't know what to do with the third button that I've soldered on before I had a plan)

## 3. Self-designed LoRa "Protocol"

LoRa is a nice technology by Semtech that enables long range, low energy data transfer of small payloads. In the Maker-World, there exists a lot of boards that contain LoRa-chips that are relatively easy to interface with in the Arduino IDE. I chose an ESP32-microcontroller-board with a LoRa chip (also battery charging capability). The ESP32 is a powerful chip with versatile features, perfect for IoT-devices. And it is also programmable over USB via the Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO).

However, LoRa does not have a builtin security and you broadcast it to everyone. As I want to see only the data from my IoT-Node, I kind of built my own security solution:

**On the IoT-Node**
1. The IoT-Node under the beehive collects all the data, and then appends it step by step to a string in float-format, comma-separated. This is the payload.
2. The node generates a hash based on the payload string plus password-string appended. The password is stored in the flash memory of both the IoT node and gateway.
3. The node sends the payload plus hash appended over LoRa (using spreading factor 12, standard bandwidth)

**On the Gateway**
If a LoRa package arrives at the gateway:
1. The gateway stores the whole LoRa packet and stores payload and hash separately
3. The gateway also tries to generate the same hash of the packet with its own password
4. If the hash is equal, I treat the payload as authenticated. If not (or the format/syntax of the package is wrong, I treat it someone else's package)
5. I upload only authenticated values to the Influx data base
6. I upload not-authenticated messages to another field (maybe, an alien wants to text me?)


### Why not using LoRaWAN?
I also could have chosen to just use the standard LoRaWAN protocol, but then I also would have needed to spend 100 euros or so on an open LoRaWAN gateway. I had two LoRa-capable devices laying around already so I chose using them instead.


## 4. Web solution

<img src="./img/Grafana-Solution.png" width="80%">

View the live hive data at: [hivecom.neozeo.de](hivecom.neozeo.de)!

Webservice architecture:
- 1-blu.de virtual linux server (Ubuntu 20 LTS)
- Docker:
    - Portainer for docker management
    - Nginx reverse proxy for subdomain management
    - Influx DB for storing hive data (and maybe trigger webhooks for notifications in the future)
    - Grafana for displaying data from Influx DB

To get this project finally done, I had to do a lot of smaller projects that somehow converged to the final system. I didn't plan these steps, but at the end it somehow came all together.

## Road map side-projects (not in order)

3. Documenting the whole f***ing project

# First analysis of the data

Coming soon. But I already see that the humidity sensor shows 99.9% humidity all the time :/, we will see

# Failed experiments

## Using cheap weight cells

<img src="./img/cheap-weight-cells.png">

I tried using cheap weight cells (ca. 13 euros sum) from Amazon, but the values had a difference of ~130g from the real weight. Also, for every measurement, the values differed from the previous values a lot and I didn't got a clear outcome. I wanted more precise values.

## Designing a custom DHT22 sensor housing for the inside of the hive

<img src="./img/dht22-cases.png">

<img src="./img/dht22 inside.png" width=20%>

I've heard that bees close holes of specific sizes in the beehive to prevent other insects to getting inside the hive. For this, they use their self produced propolis, that is also antibacterial and protects from diseases. Research in the internet did not reveal a specific hole size that gets closed, however it should be between 1-6mm. I designed different cases for the DHT22 to test that out.

However it didn't matter because of the humidity always beeing wet and also broke
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

## Getting good temperature-weight-calibration

<img src="./img/temperature-experiment.png" width=80%>

Probably a little embarrassing, as I tried to measure the temperature-dependancy with a hair dryer in a verrry DIY way. I tried to put one DHT22 directly next to weight scale between the wooden boards, but it worked as well as it looked xD. I put the books around the weight scale to prevent the warm air going fast outside the scale again.

Here is some data I collected in this experiment:

<img src="./img/temperature-dependancy.png" width=70%>

However, sometimes the upload process failed and I didn't know, what to do exactly with this data. Having a low-temperature oven or some
